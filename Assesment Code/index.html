  <h1> About Me. </h1>
  <body>
    <p> Hey, I'm Megan but most people call me Meg. I have recently made the choice to legally change my name to Adelaide, Addie for short. I'm 18 years of age, and usually live with my mum and twin sister in a small town known as Bracknell. I spend a lot of my free time using Discord to talk to friends, as well as drawing. </p>
